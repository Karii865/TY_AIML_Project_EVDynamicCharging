# TY_AIML_Project_EV_DynamicCharging
An Smart EV Charging System built with Python. This project uses predictive analytics to replace inefficient static pricing and uses Random Forest for cost prediction, ARIMA for demand forecasting and KMeans for user segmentation. This is a Novel dynamic pricing engine based on demand, renewable share, and carbon intensity, all wrapped in a Tkinter GUI.
